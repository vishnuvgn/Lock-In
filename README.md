# Lock In

> **Stay focused by blocking distracting sites.**

## Overview
**Lock In** is a no-nonsense productivity extension that helps you stay focused by blocking websites that distract you.  
No coins, no tokens, no streaks, no “share with friends” gimmicks — just clean, effective blocking so you can get work done.

- Block distracting websites
- Lightweight and fast
- Simple, intuitive design
- Forever free & open source

## Why Lock In?
Most focus tools try to gamify productivity. That works for some people, but for many it just adds clutter.  
Lock In takes the opposite approach: a single purpose, done well. Add sites to your blocklist, set a focus timer, and get back to work.

## Features
- Add/remove sites to your blocklist with one click
- Lock in for a set time or run indefinitely
- Works out of the box — no accounts or setup required

2. Click the extension icon to open options
3. Add websites you want to block
4. Hit **Start** — and you’re locked in
